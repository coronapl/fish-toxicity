the dataset used to train this model:

The QSAR model uses six molecular descriptors to predict the acute aquatic toxicity towards the fathead minnow. Here's a brief explanation of each feature:

- MLOGP (Molecular Logarithm of Partition Coefficient): This is a measure of the lipophilicity of a molecule, which describes how easily it can dissolve in a lipid (fat) environment. The MLOGP value is calculated by partitioning the molecule between octanol and water, and taking the logarithm of the ratio of the concentration of the molecule in octanol to that in water.

- CIC0 (Wiener Connectivity Index): This is a graph-theoretical index that reflects the connectivity of a molecule's atoms. It is defined as half the sum of the lengths of all paths between all pairs of atoms in the molecule.

- GATS1i (Geary Autocorrelation of lag 1 weighted by Atomic masses): This is a 2D autocorrelation descriptor that captures the spatial arrangement of the atoms in a molecule. It reflects the similarity of the atomic masses of pairs of atoms separated by a distance of 1 bond length.

- NdssC (Number of attached carbonyl, carboxyl, and thiocarboxyl groups): This descriptor counts the number of carbonyl (C=O), carboxyl (COOH), and thiocarboxyl (C=S) groups attached to the atoms in a molecule.

- NdsCH (Number of attached carbon and hydrogen atoms): This descriptor counts the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms attached to the atoms in a molecule.

- SM1_Dz(Z) (3D-MoRSE descriptor representing electrostatic potential): This is a 3D descriptor that reflects the distribution of electrostatic potential around a molecule. It is calculated by dividing the molecule into overlapping spheres and calculating the moments of the electrostatic potential within each sphere. The SM1_Dz(Z) descriptor specifically measures the dipole potential of the molecule.
